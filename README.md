### [Simple Chatty Bot](https://hyperskill.org/projects/97)

Are you lonely? Now you don't have to! You can always talk to a bot!

This project goal is to create simple chatty bot which can keep you company if you ever feel lonely. It will also guess your age and test your knowledge about programming. Isn't it wonderful!?

**Example:**

![chatty-bot-example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107406800/200595556-00effa93-5ba6-425a-8468-bd850f6d927e.PNG)


### [Coffee Machine](https://hyperskill.org/projects/68?track=2)

WHO WANTS COFFEE!?

A little more advanced python project that is about building a coffe machine simulator. The coffe machine makes three types of coffee: espresso, cappuccino, and latte. If there isn't enough ingredients, it shows a notification. The user can fill machine with water, milk, coffe and cups needed to make a coffee. The user can also take money which machine collected from selling coffee.

This project is all about understanding working with functions, loops and conditions.

**Example:**

![coffee-machine-example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107406800/200608691-f3c464b7-fe5a-439b-90ee-50ff4beb47bb.PNG)

### [Markdown Editor](https://hyperskill.org/projects/162?track=2)

This program allows user to input text and choose formatter to transform it. At the end given text is saved to a *.md* file.

Project gives an opportunity to learn some Markdown basics and file handling.

**Example:**

![markdown-editor-example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107406800/200625084-a533cdd9-c94a-45ec-afef-64ff47633a14.png)


### [Hangman](https://hyperskill.org/projects/69?track=2)
This project is about programming a Hangman game.

Hangman is a popular puzzle game where you try to guess a word letter by letter. If you fail, you'll be “hanged”. If you win, you'll survive.

**Example:**

![hangman-example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107406800/200621766-a2ac0992-0fbb-4d62-bdaa-bd66fd4fee52.PNG)


### [Simple Tic-Tac-Toe](https://hyperskill.org/projects/73?track=2)

Are you bored? So what do you say about playing some tic-tac-toe? You don't even need paper and pencil. Just take your friend and start playing!

This project gives opportunity to learn about exception handling, list comprehension and nested lists.

**Example:**

![tic-tac-toe-example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107406800/200634564-0f96a2f0-976d-46e7-843b-4e954770d2e8.PNG)


### [Currency Converter](https://hyperskill.org/projects/157?track=2)

The aim of this project is to write a currency converter program that uses a third-party service. The program calculates the amount of money user get by converting one currency to another.

This projects implements many concepts of Python — basic types, variables, arithmetic operations, loops, and working with files. And some more advanced features like: JSON format, how to work with the network and how to use requests module.

**Example:**

![currency-converter-example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107406800/200634495-54fa2cb1-0b16-4fc5-be7f-43e75fa8187f.PNG)


### [University Admission Procedure](https://hyperskill.org/projects/163?track=2)

This project is about creating program that decides which university candidates will be accepted based on given requirements.
It is a great opportunity to practice loops and various mathematical operations, learn how to handle files and different types of collections such as lists (including nested lists) and dictionaries.

### [Convoy Shipping Company](https://hyperskill.org/projects/151)

You're employed at "Convoy", a family transport company. Things are not going well financially, so your bosses want you to create a database to manage the company's assets in a better way and introduce scoring machines to automate some work. You will be dealing with different file formats to export data to various systems.

This project helps to learn how to: export data from an XLSX file to a CSV format, prepare the data to populate an SQLite database, how scoring machines are built, and how to select which data should be exported to other systems (in JSON and XML formats).

### [Text Generator](https://hyperskill.org/projects/134)

Program predicting the next word in a pseudo-sentence based on the previous words in sequence. It was the opportunity to get better understanding of natural language processing, preprocessing and NLTK python library.
